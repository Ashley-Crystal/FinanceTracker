Trusted financial APIs ensure accurate and real-time data integration.

🎯 Purpose and Goals
The main objective of FinanceTracker is to simplify personal finance management through automation and visual insights.

📧 Receive automatic weekly summary emails

💰 Monitor savings goals and calculate net worth over time

🌍 Convert currencies when budgeting in a new country

This tool is especially useful for individuals relocating to a new city, where managing expenses is crucial.

🚧 Phase 1 – Core Budgeting Features
🎯 Goal: Build a functional budgeting web app integrated with Firefly III.

✅ Tasks:
Set up a backend (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask) to connect with Firefly III.

Authenticate via OAuth2 or Personal Access Token.

Implement backend endpoints and frontend UIs for:

Transaction management (create, view, edit, delete)

Budget creation and category assignment

Monthly spending reports with category breakdown

Build frontend UI in React or Vue:

Forms for entering transactions and setting budgets

Dashboard views with interactive charts and tables

📌 Outcomes:
Users can log expenses, create budgets per category, and view summarized spending on an interactive dashboard.

✉️ Phase 2 – Email Summaries Feature
🎯 Goal: Enable scheduled weekly email summaries of user spending.

✅ Tasks:
Use Firefly III API to fetch weekly transactions and summarize expenses.

Integrate Mailgun API:

Sign up for the free tier (100 emails/day, 1 domain)

Use REST or SMTP to send summary emails (HTML format with charts/tables)

Add a backend scheduler (e.g., cron or node-cron):

Automatically run summary generation job (e.g., Sundays at 8 PM)

Format and send the email via Mailgun

📌 Outcomes:
Users receive a clear summary of their weekly spending habits with charts and budget alerts directly in their inbox.

📈 Phase 3 – Net Worth & Savings Dashboard
🎯 Goal: Add integration with YNAB to track savings and net worth.

✅ Tasks:
Implement YNAB API integration using OAuth or Personal Access Token

Fetch the following data:

User budgets, account balances, liabilities, and goals

Add frontend enhancements:

Line chart showing net worth over time

Progress bars for savings goal tracking

Unified dashboard combining Firefly and YNAB data

📌 Outcomes:
Users gain a full picture of their financial health—budgets, savings, expenses, and net worth—all in one place.
